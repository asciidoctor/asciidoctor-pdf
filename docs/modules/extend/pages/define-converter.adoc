= Create an Extended Converter
:url-infoq-template: https://github.com/mraible/infoq-mini-book/blob/main/src/main/ruby/asciidoctor-pdf-extensions.rb

== Define an extended converter

Starting with Asciidoctor 2, defining an extending converter and registering it in place of the original is straightforward.

.custom-pdf-converter.rb
[source,ruby]
----
class CustomPDFConverter < (Asciidoctor::Converter.for 'pdf')
  register_for 'pdf'

  # overrides go here
end
----

As it stands, the converter doesn't do anything differently than the primary converter because we haven't yet overridden any of its methods.

== Override a method

Let's start by overriding the thematic break--the horizontal rule--to make it render like a ribbon.

[source,ruby]
----
  def convert_thematic_break node
    theme_margin :thematic_break, :top
    stroke_horizontal_rule 'FF0000', line_width: 0.5, line_style: :solid
    move_down 1
    stroke_horizontal_rule 'FF0000', line_width: 1, line_style: :solid
    move_down 1
    stroke_horizontal_rule 'FF0000', line_width: 0.5, line_style: :solid
    theme_margin :thematic_break, :bottom
  end
----

This converter will replace the thematic break with a red ribbon.

Another way to override the converter is to modify the node, then delegate back to the primary converter.

== Modify a node

Let's put a page break before all paragraphs unless the cursor is at the top of the page.
We'll call `super` to let the primary converter handle the work of rendering the paragraph.

[source,ruby]
----
  def convert_paragraph node
    bounds.move_past_bottom unless at_page_top?
    super
  end
----

Now let's look at how to modify an inline element.
Let's say we want to override the kbd element.

[source,ruby]
----
  def convert_inline_kbd node
    %(<strong><color rgb="AA0000">#{(node.attr 'keys').join ' + '}</color></strong>)
  end
----

Refer to the primary converter to discover the pseudo-HTML you can use for inline elements.

== Customize a page using an extended converter

So far we've just been biting around the edges.
A more realistic use case is to customize the part title page in a multi-part book.
Since this is a specialized section element, there's a dedicated method named `inscribe_part_title` that you'll need to override.

Let's customize the part title page by making the background orange, making the font white, centering the title on the page, and disabling the running content.
(You don't need to start a new page before and after the part title since that's already done for you).

[source,ruby]
----
  def inscribe_part_title node, title, opts = {}
    fill_absolute_bounds 'E64C3D'
    move_down 20
    typeset_text title, (calc_line_metrics 1.5), color: 'FFFFFF', inline_format: true, align: :center, size: 42
    page.instance_variable_set :@imported_page, true
  end
----

The method `typeset_text` and `calc_line_metrics` are provided by Asciidoctor PDF to make writing text easier.
If you wanted, you could just use the low-level `text` method provided by Prawn.

To find all the available methods to override, consult the {url-api-docs}[API docs^].
For deeper examples of how to override the behavior of the converter, refer to the extended converter in the {url-infoq-template}[InfoQ Mini-Book template^].

== Keep section title with content

If the section title is followed by content that doesn't fit on the current page, the converter will leave the section title behind, making it an orphan.
You can fix this behavior by overridding the `arrange_section` method in a custom converter.

The default implementation of `arrange_section` only checks whether at least one line of content fits below the section title on the current page.
A custom converter can take this opportunity to use `dry_run` to make an attempt to write content in the remaining space on the page.
If no content is written, it can advance to the next page before the section title is written.

[,ruby]
----
def arrange_section sect, title, opts = {}
  return if @y >= (@margin_box.absolute_top / 3) # <1>
  orphaned = nil
  dry_run single_page: true do # <2>
    start_page = page
    theme_font :heading, level: opts[:level] do
    if opts[:part]
      inscribe_part_title sect, title, opts # <3>
    elsif opts[:chapterlike]
      inscribe_chapter_title sect, title, opts # <3>
    else
      inscribe_general_heading sect, title, opts # <3>
    end
    if page == start_page
      page.tare_content_stream
      orphaned = stop_if_first_page_empty { traverse sect } # <4>
    end
  end
  start_new_page if orphaned # <5>
  nil
end
----
<1> An optional optimization to skip this logic if the cursor is above the bottom third of the page.
<2> Initiate a dry run up to the end of the current page.
<3> Render the section title as normal.
<4> Proceed with converting content until the end of the page is reached. Returns true if content is written, false otherwise.
<5> Start new page before rendering section title if orphaned.

Now that you've seen some examples of how to extend the converter, let's look at how to use it.
