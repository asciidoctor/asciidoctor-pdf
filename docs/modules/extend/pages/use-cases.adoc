:navtitle: Customization Use Cases

This page presents common use cases that can be accomplished by extending and customizing the converter.
In xref:create-converter.adoc[], we were just biting around the edges of what you can do with an extended converter.
This page gets into more realistic use cases.
Each section introduces a different use case and presents the code for an extended converter you can use as a starting point.

== Custom thematic break

One of the simplest ways to extend the converter is to make a thematic break.
For this case, we'll override the convert handler method for a thematic break, which is `convert_thematic_break`.
The thematic break only consists of line graphics, no text.
That means we can make use of graphics fill and stroke methods provided by Asciidoctor PDF or Prawn.

== Custom part title

A common need is to add extra styling to the title page for a part in a multi-part book.
Since this is a specialized section element, there's a dedicated method named `ink_part_title` that you can override.
The converter already allocates a dedicated page for the part title (so there's no need to worry about doing that).
The extended converter can override the method that inks the part title to add extra decoration or content to that page.

Let's customize the part title page by making the background orange, making the font white, aligning the title to the right, adding a line below it, and switching off the running content.

[,ruby]
----
include::example$pdf-converter-custom-part-title.rb[]
----

The method `ink_prose` is provided by Asciidoctor PDF to make writing text to the page easier.
If you wanted, you could just use the low-level `text` method provided by Prawn.

To find all the available methods to override, consult the {url-api-docs}[API docs^].

== Custom chapter title

A similar need is to add extra styling to the title of a chapter, or to place it on a page by itself.
The extended converter can override the method that inks the chapter title to add extra decoration or content to that page, then insert a page break afterwards.

[,ruby]
----
include::example$pdf-converter-custom-chapter-title.rb[]
----

== Chapter image

As another way to customize the chapter title, you may want to add an image above the chapter title if specified.
Once again, the extended converter can override the method that inks the chapter title and use it as an opportunity to insert an image.

.Extended converter with chapter image
[,ruby]
----
include::example$pdf-converter-chapter-image.rb[]
----

The path to the image is controlled using the `image` block attribute on the chapter.

[,asciidoc]
----
[image=gears.png]
== Chapter Title
----

== Per chapter TOC

In addition to (or instead of) a TOC for the whole book, you may want to insert a TOC per chapter immediately following the chapter title.
Inserting a TOC into the PDF is a two-step process.
First, you need to allocate the space for the chapter TOC using the `allocate_toc` method.
Then, you need to come back and ink the TOC after the chapter has been rendered using the `ink_toc` method.

.Extended converter with TOC per chapter
[,ruby]
----
include::example$pdf-converter-chapter-toc.rb[]
----

The chapter TOC can is activated by setting the `chapter-toc` attribute and the depth of the TOC is controlled using the `chapter-toclevels` attribute.
For example:

[,asciidoc]
----
= Book Title
:chapter-toc:
:chapter-toclevels: 2
----

== Paragraph numbering

To help with content auditing or coorelation, you may want to add a number in front of each paragraph.
You can do this first by assigning a number to each paragraph in the document in the `init_pdf` method.
Then, you can add this number in the left margin at the start of each paragraph by overriding the `convert_paragraph` method.

----
include::example$pdf-converter-numbered-paragraphs.rb[]

== Avoid break after section title

This functionality is already provided by the converter if you set the `breakable` option on section title.
The code is presented here to explain how it works and if you want to make this behavior automatic.

If the section title is followed by content that doesn't fit on the current page, and the `breakable` option is not set on the section title, the converter will leave the section title behind, making it an orphan.
You can fix this behavior by overridding the `arrange_section` method in an extended converter.

This extended converter takes this opportunity to use `dry_run` to make an attempt to write content in the remaining space on the page.
If no content is written, it advances to the next page before the section title is written.

.Extended converter that avoids a page break after a section title
[,ruby]
----
include::example$pdf-converter-avoid-break-after-section-title.rb[]
----
<.> An optional optimization to skip this logic if the cursor is above the bottom third of the page.
<.> Initiate a dry run up to the end of the current page.
<.> Render the section title as normal.
<.> Proceed with converting content until the end of the page is reached. Returns true if content is written, false otherwise.
<.> Start new page before rendering section title if orphaned.

== Additional TOC entries

By default, the table of contents (TOC) only includes section references.
If you want to include additional entries in the TOC, or to filter the sections that are included, you can extend the converter and override the `get_entries_for_toc` method.
This method is invoked for each parent entry in the TOC, starting from the document.

.Extended converter that adds additional entries to the TOC
[,ruby]
----
include::example$pdf-converter-additional-toc-entries.rb[]
----

The depth of the TOC is automatically controlled by the `toclevels` attributes.
Once this limit is reached, the converter will not call `get_entries_for_toc` for that parent (as none of its children will be included in the TOC).

== Indent block image

If you want all (or some) block images to be indented by an amount specified in the theme, you can override the convert handler method for block images, `convert_image`, and call super within an indented context.

.Extended converter that indents block images
[,ruby]
----
include::example$pdf-converter-image-indent.rb[]
----

The `indent` DSL method adds padding to either side of the content area, delegates to the specified code block, then shaves it back off.

This converter works when a custom theme defines the `image-indent` key, as follow:

[,yaml]
----
image:
  indent: [0.5in, 0]
----
