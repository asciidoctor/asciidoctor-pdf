== Require the extended converter

To use an extended converter, require it by passing the path to the `-r` flag when calling the `asciidoctor-pdf` command:

 $ asciidoctor-pdf -r ./extended-pdf-converter.rb doc.adoc

The converter will self-register with the `pdf` backend and thus get used as the Asciidoctor PDF converter.

If you're using Asciidoctor PDF via the `asciidoctorj` command provided by AsciidoctorJ, you'll need to first require the `asciidoctor-pdf` gem.
This step is necessary since the extended converter assumes that Asciidoctor PDF has already been required by the time it's required itself.

 $ asciidoctorj -b pdf -r asciidoctor-pdf -r ./extended-pdf-converter.rb doc.adoc

That's all there is to it!
