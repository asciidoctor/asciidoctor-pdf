== Require the extended converter

To use an extended converter, require it by passing the path to the `-r` flag when calling the `asciidoctor-pdf` command:

 $ asciidoctor-pdf -r ./extended-pdf-converter.rb doc.adoc

The converter will self-register with the `pdf` backend and thus get used as the Asciidoctor PDF converter.

That's all there is to it!
