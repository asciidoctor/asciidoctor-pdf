= Create an Extended Converter
:navtitle: Create a Converter

== Register an extended converter

Asciidoctor provides a mechanism for looking up a registered converter so it can be extended (i.e., used as a base class), then another mechanism for registering the extended converter in its place.
Let's see how that looks.

.extended-pdf-converter.rb
[,ruby]
----
include::example$extended-pdf-converter.rb[]
----

When this script is required by Asciidoctor, it will replace the primary converter with the extended one automatically.
As it stands, this converter doesn't do anything different than the primary converter because we haven't yet overridden any of its methods.

== Override a method

Let's start by overriding the thematic break (i.e., horizontal rule) to make it render like a red ribbon.

[,ruby]
----
include::example$pdf-converter-custom-thematic-break.rb[tag=convert_thematic_break]
----

To find all the available methods to override, see the {url-api-docs}[API docs^].

Now that you've made a change to the converter, let's xref:use-converter.adoc[learn how to activate it].
