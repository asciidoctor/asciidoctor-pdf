= Use an Extended Converter

== Require the extended converter

To use this converter, require it by passing the path to the `-r` flag when calling the `asciidoctor-pdf` command:

 $ asciidoctor-pdf -r ./custom-pdf-converter.rb document.adoc

That's all there is too it.
Now you're hacking the typesetting!
