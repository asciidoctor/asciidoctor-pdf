Asciidoctor PDF {page-component-version}.0 introduces several enhancements.
For a complete list of changes, see the {url-project-repo}/blob/main/CHANGELOG.adoc[CHANGELOG^].

== Enhancements

* Allow a xref:background-images.adoc#page-layout[page background image to be specified per layout] using the `+{page-layout}+` attribute reference in the target path.
* Allow the page margins for rotated pages to be configured independently using the xref:theme:page.adoc#rotated-margin[page-margin-rotated theme key] or xref:asciidoc-attributes.adoc[pdf-page-margin-rotated document attribute].
* Allow xref:breakable-and-unbreakable.adoc#section-or-discrete-heading[orphan detection to be enabled for all section titles and discrete headings] by setting xref:theme:heading.adoc#min-height-after[heading-min-height-after] to `auto` in the theme.
* Set the xref:theme:images.adoc#specify[docimagesdir attribute] when attribute substitutions are applied to a value from the theme.
* Start xref:theme:page-numbers.adoc[page numbering] and xref:theme:add-running-content.adoc#page[running content] on empty verso page before first chapter of prepress book if `start-at` value is `0`.
* Don't force a page break after a TOC with automatic placement in an article if the `title-page` attribute is set and the xref:theme:toc.adoc[value of toc-break-after theme key is auto].
* Add `--theme` option to CLI as shorthand for `-a pdf-theme`.
* Add `--sourcemap` option to CLI to enable `:sourcemap` option.
* Broaden support for xref:theme:text.adoc#font-size[relative font sizes in the theme] to more than just inline elements.
* Allow the theme to control the font properties of ordered list markers using the xref:theme:list.adoc#olist-marker[olist-marker category].
* Allow the theme to control the xref:theme:list.adoc#ulist-marker[font style of unordered list markers] per marker or all markers.

== Bug fixes

* Always set the `imagesdir` attribute to the value of `themesdir` when resolving images from theme.
* Allow the `top` keys in the `title-page` theme category to accept a fixed value (e.g., `1in`).
* Prevent orphan detection for headings (section title or discrete heading) from modifying the document state.

== Compliance

* Configure table borders to be compatible with prawn-table > 0.2.2.
* Don't coerce a font size < 1 to a relative font size; relative font size should be specified in units.
