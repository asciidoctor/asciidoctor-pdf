[#roles]
== Paragraph roles and text indent

In Asciidoctor PDF 2.0, you can define custom roles in your theme and apply them to paragraphs in your document.
See xref:theme:custom-role.adoc[] to learn how to create a custom role and xref:roles.adoc#custom[Use a custom role] for how to assign a custom role to a paragraph.

Due to the ability to assign roles to paragraphs, the `lead` category keys have been removed.
Now the lead paragraph styles are applied using the built-in role named `lead`.
See xref:theme:role.adoc#built-in[Built-in roles] for details.

To control the indent of inner paragraphs, you can set the new `prose-text-indent-inner` key in your theme.
See xref:theme:prose.adoc[] for details.

[#breakable]
== Breakable by default

In Asciidoctor PDF 2.0, the following blocks are breakable with automatic anchor and caption orphan prevention by default:

* Admonitions
* Block images
* Code blocks (literal, listing, and source)
* Examples
* Open blocks
* Quote blocks
* Sidebars
* Table of Contents
* Verses

Tables and section headings are only breakable by default.
That means table captions may be orphaned if a table breaks across pages, and a section heading and its first content block aren't kept together automatically.
However, orphan prevention can be applied to individual section headings and tables using the xref:breakable-and-unbreakable.adoc#breakable[breakable option].

[#unbreakable]
== Unbreakable option

The `unbreakable` option can be applied to delimited blocks, admonitions, and tables.
When the xref:breakable-and-unbreakable.adoc#unbreakable[unbreakable option] is applied to a block, the converter will advance the block and its caption and anchor to the next page if it detects that the block would break across pages.

== Blocks and block captions

Blocks and block captions gained a lot of new features in Asciidoctor PDF 2.0.
Here are just a few of the highlights:

Smart bottom margins::
Blocks now have smarter bottom margins that prevent extra space from being added below them, particularly when blocks are nested.
Border width::
The border width of delimited blocks, admonitions, and block images can be customized per edge with the xref:theme:blocks.adoc#border-width[border-width key].
Border style::
The border style of delimited blocks, admonitions, and block images can be changed with the xref:theme:blocks.adoc#border-style[border-style key].
Styles include dashed, dotted, double, and solid.
Line height::
Wherever font properties are accepted in the theme, you can now control the line height of blocks using the `line-height` key.
Anchor positioning::
Allow location of anchor for block to be positioned relative to content using the `block-anchor-top` key.
First line of abstract::
Allow theme to control font color of first line of abstract using `abstract-first-line-font-color` key.
Caption text-align::
The text alignment of captions can now be controlled independent of the block alignment using the `caption-text-align` theme key.
See xref:theme:caption.adoc[] for more information.
Global caption text decoration::
The text decoration style, color, and width can be applied to captions globally with the `caption-text-decoration-style`, `caption-text-decoration-color`, and `caption-text-decoration-width` theme keys.
See xref:theme:caption.adoc[] for more information.
Caption max-width::
Allow caption `max-width` to be set to percentage of content by passing argument to `fit-content` function.

.*Notable fixes for blocks*
* Syntax highlighting isn't applied to a source block if the `specialchars` substitution is disabled.
* Borders, shading, and padding aren't applied to collapsible blocks.
* The `callouts` substitution can be disabled on source blocks.

== Tables

Border widths and styles::
The table border width can be customized per edge with the xref:theme:blocks.adoc#border-width[border-width key].
The border line style can be xref:theme:tables.adoc#border-style[specified per edge by assigning an array of styles] to the `border-style` key.
Styles include dashed, dotted, and solid.

Grid widths and styles::
The width of table grid lines can be specified for rows and columns with the xref:theme:tables.adoc#grid-width[grid-width key].
The style of the grid lines can be specified for rows and columns with the xref:theme:tables.adoc#grid-style[grid-style key].
Styles include dashed, dotted, and solid.
//allow horizontal and vertical lines of table grid to be styled independently (#1875) (*@hextremist*)

.*Notable fixes for tables*
* An error message is logged if table cell is truncated.
* Instead of raising an error, log error and skip table if cell content can't fit into column width of table.
* The content of AsciiDoc table cell is prevented from overrunning content on subsequent pages.
* The top and bottom padding is taken into account when computing height of AsciiDoc table cell.
* Vertical center alignment is correctly applied to regular table cells.
* The border bottom is correctly applied to a table row when frame and grid are disabled.

== Callout lists and numbers

The theming language now has a xref:theme:callout.adoc[callout-list category].
The new theme keys let you customize the font properties, text alignment, and item spacing of callout lists.
The `callout-list` category includes the `margin-top-after-code` key that can control the top margin of callout lists that immediately follow a code block.

.*Notable fixes for callouts*
* Callout numbers in a callout list stay with primary text when an item is advanced to next page.
* A sequence of two or more callouts separated by spaces in a verbatim block are processed correctly.
* The font family assigned to `conums` in the theme is applied to the callout numbers displayed in verbatim blocks.

== Running content and page numbering

xref:theme:add-running-content.adoc#start-at[Select the page where running content starts]:: Specify the page on which the running content starts being displayed by assigning an integer to the `start-at` theme key on the `running-content` category.
Running content can also start after the TOC, wherever the TOC is placed, by assigning the keyword `after-toc` to the `start-at` key.

xref:theme:page-numbers.adoc#start-at[Configure where integer page numbering starts]:: Specify the page on which the integer (1-based) page numbering begins using the `start-at` key on the `page-numbering` category.
Integer page numbering can start at the front cover by assigning the keyword `cover` to the `start-at` key.
Or, you can have the page numbering start after the TOC, wherever the TOC is placed, by assigning `after-toc` to the `start-at` key.
Alternatively, the theme can specify an offset from the first body page where the page numbering should begin when an integer is assigned to `start-at`.

== Fonts

normal_italic:: The new `normal_italic` value for the `font-style` key resets the font style to normal, then applies the italic variant of a font family.
See xref:theme:text.adoc#font-style[Font style].
