[#roles]
== Paragraph roles and text indent

In Asciidoctor PDF 2.0, you can define custom roles in your theme and apply them to paragraphs in your document.
See xref:theme:custom-role.adoc[] to learn how to create a custom role and xref:roles.adoc#custom[Use a custom role] for how to assign a custom role to a paragraph.

Due to the ability to assign roles to paragraphs, the `lead` category keys have been removed.
Now the lead paragraph styles are applied using the built-in role named `lead`.
See xref:theme:role.adoc#built-in[Built-in roles] for details.

To control the indent of inner paragraphs, you can set the new `prose-text-indent-inner` key in your theme.
See xref:theme:prose.adoc[] for details.

== Blocks and block captions

Blocks and block captions gained a lot of new features in Asciidoctor PDF 2.0.
Here are just a few of the highlights:

Smart bottom margins::
Blocks now have smarter bottom margins that prevent extra space from being added below them, particularly when blocks are nested.
xref:theme:blocks.adoc#border-width[Border width]::
The border width of delimited blocks, admonitions, tables, and block images can be customized per edge with the `border-width` key.
xref:theme:blocks.adoc#border-style[Border style]::
The border style of delimited blocks, admonitions, tables, and block images can be changed with the `border-style` key.
Styles include dashed, dotted, double, and solid.
Line height::
Wherever font properties are accepted in the theme, you can now control the line height of blocks using the `line-height` key.
Anchor positioning::
Allow location of anchor for block to be positioned relative to content using the `block-anchor-top` key.
First line of abstract::
Allow theme to control font color of first line of abstract using `abstract-first-line-font-color` key.
Caption text-align::
The text alignment of a caption can now be controlled independent of the block alignment.
Global caption text decoration::
Allow theme to specify text decoration style, color, and width for captions.
Caption max-width::
Allow caption `max-width` to be set to percentage of content by passing argument to `fit-content` function.

.*Notable fixes for blocks*
* Syntax highlighting isn't applied to a source block if the `specialchars` substitution is disabled.
* Borders, shading, and padding aren't applied to collapsible blocks.
* The `callouts` substitution can be disabled on source blocks.

== Callout lists and numbers

The theming language now has a xref:theme:callout.adoc[callout-list category].
The new theme keys let you customize the font properties, text alignment, and item spacing of callout lists.
The `callout-list` category includes the `margin-top-after-code` key that can control the top margin of callout lists that immediately follow a code block.

.*Notable fixes for callouts*
* Callout numbers in a callout list stay with primary text when an item is advanced to next page.
* A sequence of two or more callouts separated by spaces in a verbatim block are processed correctly.
* The font family assigned to `conums` in the theme is applied to the callout numbers displayed in verbatim blocks.

== Running content and page numbering

xref:theme:add-running-content.adoc#start-at[Running content start page]:: Specify the exact page on which the running content starts by assigning an integer to the `start-at` theme key on the `running-content` category.
Running content can also start after the TOC, wherever the TOC is placed, by assigning the keyword `after-toc` to the `start-at` key.

== Fonts

normal_italic:: The new `normal_italic` value for the `font-style` key resets the font style to normal, then applies the italic variant of a font family.
See xref:theme:text.adoc#font-style[Font style].

== Deprecated

The following features are deprecated with the release of Asciidoctor PDF 2.0.0 and will be removed in the next major release.

* The `blockquote` category prefix is deprecated in the theme; use the `quote` prefix instead.
See xref:theme:quote.adoc[].
* The `key` category prefix is deprecated in the theme; use the `kbd` prefix instead.
See xref:theme:keyboard.adoc[].
* The `literal` category prefix is deprecated in the theme; use the `codespan` prefix instead.
See xref:theme:codespan.adoc[].
* The `outline-list` category prefix is deprecated in the theme; use the `list` prefix instead.
See xref:theme:list.adoc[].
* The `Optimizer#generate_file` method is deprecated; use `Optimizer#optimize_file` instead.
