= Verbatim Blocks

Verbatim blocks are listing, literal, and source blocks.

== Verbatim blocks and performance

Verbatim blocks are rendered with a shaded background.
In order to calculate the dimensions of the shaded region, Asciidoctor PDF has to "`dry run`" the block to determine how many pages it consumes.
While this strategy has a low impact when processing shorter blocks, it can drastically deteriorate performance when processing a block that spans dozens of pages.
As a general rule of thumb, you should avoid creating verbatim blocks which span more than a handful of pages.
