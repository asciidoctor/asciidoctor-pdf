= Title Page
:description: The title page contains the doctitle, author, date, and revision information.

The Asciidoctor PDF converter introduces a dedicated title page at the start of the document.
The title page contains the doctitle, author, date, and revision info.
The title page can be styled using the theme and reserved page attributes.

[#activate]
== Activate the title page

The title page is enabled if one of these conditions is met:

* the `doctype` document attribute is set to `book`, or
* the `title-page` document attribute is set with an empty value in the document header.

The title page is only enabled by default for the `book` doctype.
The `doctype` is set and assigned `book` either in the document header or using the CLI.

[,asciidoc]
----
= Document Title
:doctype: book
----

To force the title page to be used for other doctypes, set the `title-page` attribute in the document header.

[,asciidoc]
----
= Document Title
:title-page:
----

If a front cover image is specified, the title page comes after the front cover.
When the title page is enabled, the table of contents also gets its own page (or pages, if necessary).

[#notitle-attribute]
== Deactivate with notitle attribute

For documents that declare the `book` doctype, the title page can be omitted by setting the `notitle` attribute in the AsciiDoc document header.
(Its counterpart, `:!showtitle:`, does not work with Asciidoctor PDF.)

[,asciidoc]
----
= Document Title
:doctype: book
:notitle:
----

The title page can also be xref:theme:title-pages.adoc#deactivate[deactivated from the theme] by setting the value of the `title-page` category key to `false`.
For all other doctypes, the title page is not added by default.
In that case, setting the `:notitle:` attribute only removes the document title from the first page of content.

[#background]
== Background image

You can place a background image on the title page using the `title-page-background-image` document attribute.

[,asciidoc]
----
= Document Title
Author Name
:title-page-background-image: image:title-bg.png[]
----

By default, page background images are automatically scaled to fit the bounds of the page (i.e., `fit=contain`) and centered (i.e., `position=center`).
See xref:background-images.adoc[] to learn more.

[#logo]
== Logo image

You can place a logo image on the title page using the `title-logo-image` document attribute.

[,asciidoc]
----
= Document Title
Author Name
:title-logo-image: image:logo.png[top=25%,align=center,pdfwidth=0.5in]
----

When the value is specified using the inline image macro, you position and scale the image using the accepted macro attributes.
