= Title Page

The Asciidoctor PDF converter introduces a dedicated title page at the start of the document.
The title page contains the doctitle, author, date, and revision info.
If a front cover image is specified, the title page comes after the front cover.
The title page can be styled using the theme and reserved page attributes.

== Enable the title page

The title page is enabled if one of these conditions is met:

* The document has the `book` doctype.
* The `title-page` attribute is set (with an empty value) in the document header.

When the title page is enabled, the table of contents also gets its own page (or pages, if necessary).
