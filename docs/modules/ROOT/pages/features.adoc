[#limitations]
== Known limitations

* Footnotes are always displayed as endnotes (at the bottom of the last page of a chapter for books; at the bottom of the last page of the document for all other doctypes).
*Footnotes cannot be displayed at the current bottom of the page because the PDF generator does not support content reflows* (see {url-project-issues}/85#issuecomment-577412975[#85^] for reasoning).
* Table cells that exceed the height of a single page are truncated with a warning (see https://github.com/prawnpdf/prawn-table/issues/41[prawn-table#41^]).
* A rowspan in a table that exceeds the height of a single page will be orphaned and the remaining columns will be truncated (see {url-project-issues}/403#issuecomment-1133840210[#403^]).
* A column can't be assigned a `width` of `0%` or a `width` less than the width of a single character.
The converter will skip the table and emit a warning if such a case occurs.
* A column can't be set to `autowidth` if the width of all the other columns in the table meets or exceeds 100%.
The converter will skip the table and emit a warning if such a case occurs.
* An inline image in a table cell will shrink to fit (rather than force the column wider) if the width of the image exceeds the width of the column; you can increase the width of the column using `cols` or convert the cell to an AsciiDoc table cell and, preferably, use a block image (see {url-project-issues}/830[#830^]).
* An inline image with a percentage `width` value in an `autowidth` table cell is resized relative to its intrinsic width.
The space reserved for the image matches its intrinsic width.
This matches the behavior of HTML.
* Prawn does not support double-wide box drawing glyphs correctly, so box drawings aren't aligned properly in verbatim blocks (see https://github.com/prawnpdf/prawn/issues/1002[prawn#1002^]).
* Orphan and widow support is limited to delimited blocks, block images, and admonitions; therefore, a page break may occur between a section title and its first block of content
 ** to avoid an orphaned section title, you can add the xref:breakable-and-unbreakable.adoc[breakable option] to the section
 ** to avoid an orphaned caption on a table, add the xref:breakable-and-unbreakable.adoc[breakable option] to the table
* If a no-break hyphen is surrounded by formatted text on both sides (or is formatted individually), it will not prevent a line break.
* Images cannot float.
* Only a single column is supported (except for the index section).
* You cannot use inline HTML (like a link or emphasized text) in a source block that also uses syntax highlighting.
These two technologies don't mix in the PDF generation process due to how the syntax highlighters work.
* Verse blocks do not use a fixed-width font by default, but you can control this setting xref:theme:verse.adoc[using the theme].
* Cannot use remote inline image in the doctitle or a section title with an automatic ID
