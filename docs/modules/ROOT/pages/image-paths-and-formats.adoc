= Image Paths and Formats

Images are resolved at the time the converter runs.
That means they need to be located where the converter can find them and be in a format it can read.

== imagesdir attribute

Relative image paths in a document are resolved relative to the value of the `imagesdir` attribute.
This is effectively the same as how the built-in HTML converter works when the `data-uri` attribute is set.
The `imagesdir` is blank by default, which means relative images paths are resolved relative to the input document.
Relative images paths in the theme are resolved relative to the value of the `pdf-themesdir` attribute (which defaults to the directory of the theme file).
The `imagesdir` attribute is not used when resolving an image path in the theme file.
Absolute image paths are used as is.

If the image is an SVG, and the SVG includes a nested raster image (PNG or JPG) with a relative path, that path is resolved relative to the directory that contains the SVG.

The converter will refuse to embed an image if the target is a URI (including image references in an SVG) unless the `allow-uri-read` attribute is enabled via the CLI or API.

If you use a linked image in an SVG, the width and height of that image must be specified.
Otherwise, the SVG library will fail to process it.

== Asciidoctor Diagram integration

Asciidoctor PDF provides seamless integration with Asciidoctor Diagram by setting the `data-uri` attribute by default.
When the `data-uri` attribute is set, Asciidoctor Diagram returns the absolute path to the generated image, which Asciidoctor PDF can then locate.
(This makes sense since technically, Asciidoctor Diagram must embed the image in the document, similar in spirit to the `data-uri` feature for HTML).
This means the input directory and the output directory (and thus the `imagesoutdir`) can differ and Asciidoctor PDF will still be able to locate the generated image.

== Image formats

The following image types (and corresponding file extensions) are supported:

* PNG (.png)
* JPEG (.jpg)
* SVG (.svg)

CAUTION: The GIF (.gif), TIFF (.tiff), WebP (.webp), BMP (.bmp), and interlaced PNG formats are not supported unless you install prawn-gmagick.
See <<other-image-formats>> for details.

In order to embed an image into a PDF, Asciidoctor PDF must understand how to read it.
To perform this work, Asciidoctor delegates to the underlying libraries.
{url-prawn}[Prawn^] provides support for reading JPG and PNG images.
{url-prawn-svg}[prawn-svg^] brings support for SVG images.
Without any additional libraries, those are the only supported image file formats.

[#other-image-formats]
=== Supporting additional image file formats

If you need support for additional image formats, such as GIF, TIFF, WebP, BMP, or interlaced PNG--and you don't want to convert those images to a supported format--you must install the {url-prawn-gmagick}[prawn-gmagick^] gem.
prawn-gmagick is an extension for Prawn based on {url-graphicsmagick}[GraphicsMagick^] that adds support for all the image formats recognized by that library.
prawn-gmagick has the added benefit of significantly reducing the time it takes to generate a PDF containing a lot of images.

The prawn-gmagick gem uses native extensions to compile against GraphicsMagick.
This system prerequisite limits installation to Linux and OSX.
Please refer to the {url-prawn-gmagick}[README for prawn-gmagick^] to learn how to install it.

Once this gem is installed, Asciidoctor automatically loads it, then delegates to it to handle all image embedding.
In addition to support for additional image file formats, this gem also speeds up image processing considerably.
We highly recommend using this gem if you're able to install it.

== Fonts in SVG images

Asciidoctor PDF uses {url-prawn-svg}[prawn-svg^] to embed SVGs in the PDF document, including SVGs generated by Asciidoctor Diagram.

Actually, it's not accurate to say that prawn-svg embeds the SVG.
Rather, prawn-svg is an SVG _renderer_.
prawn-svg translates an SVG into native PDF text and graphic objects.
You can think of the SVG as a sequence of drawing commands.
The result becomes indistinguishable from other PDF objects.

What that means for text is that any font family used for text in the SVG _must_ be registered in the Asciidoctor PDF theme file (and thus with Prawn).
Otherwise, Prawn will fall back to using the closest matching built-in (afm) font from PDF (e.g., sans-serif becomes Helvetica).
Recall that afm fonts only support basic Latin.
As we like to say, PDF is xref:theme:font-support.adoc#built-in[bring your own font].

If you're using Asciidoctor Diagram to generate SVGs to embed in the PDF, you likely need to specify the default font the diagramming tool uses.
Let's assume you are making a plantuml diagram.

To set the font used in the diagram, first create a file named [.path]_plantuml.cfg_ and populate it with the following content:

----
skinparam defaultFontName Noto Serif
----

TIP: You can choose any font name that is registered in your Asciidoctor PDF theme file.
When using the default theme, your options are "Noto Serif", "M+ 1mn", and "M+ 1p Fallback".

Next, pass that path to the `plantumlconfig` attribute in your AsciiDoc document (or set the attribute via the CLI or API):

----
:plantumlconfig: plantuml.cfg
----

Clear the cache of your diagrams and run Asciidoctor PDF with Asciidoctor Diagram enabled.
The diagrams will be generated using Noto Serif as the default font, and Asciidoctor PDF will know what to do.

The bottom line is this:
If you're using fonts in your SVG, and you want those fonts to be preserved, those fonts must be defined in the Asciidoctor PDF theme file.
