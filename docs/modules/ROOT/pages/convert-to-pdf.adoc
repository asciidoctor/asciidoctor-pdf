= Convert AsciiDoc to PDF

== Run Asciidoctor PDF

Assuming all the required gems install properly, verify you can run the `asciidoctor-pdf` script:

 $ asciidoctor-pdf -v

If you see the version of Asciidoctor PDF printed, you're ready to use Asciidoctor PDF!

Let's grab an AsciiDoc document to distill and start putting Asciidoctor PDF to use.
If you don't already have an AsciiDoc document, you can download and use the xref:attachment$basic-example.adoc[Basic Example AsciiDoc file].

.basic-example.adoc
[,asciidoc]
....
include::attachment$basic-example.adoc[]
....

It's time to convert the AsciiDoc document directly to PDF.

== Convert an AsciiDoc document to a PDF

IMPORTANT: You'll need the `rouge` gem installed to run this example since it uses the `source-highlighter` attribute with the value of `rouge`.

Converting to PDF is as simple as running the `asciidoctor-pdf` script using Ruby and passing our AsciiDoc document as the first argument.

 $ asciidoctor-pdf basic-example.adoc

This command is just a shorthand way of running:

 $ asciidoctor -r asciidoctor-pdf -b pdf basic-example.adoc

The `asciidoctor-pdf` command just saves you from having to remember all those flags.
That's why we created it.

When the script completes, you should see the file [.path]_basic-example.pdf_ in the same directory.
Open the [.path]_basic-example.pdf_ file with a PDF viewer to see the result.
