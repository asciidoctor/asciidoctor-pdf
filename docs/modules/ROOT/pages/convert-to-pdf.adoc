= Convert AsciiDoc to PDF

== Run Asciidoctor PDF

Assuming all the required gems install properly, verify you can run the `asciidoctor-pdf` command:

 $ asciidoctor-pdf -v

If you see the version of Asciidoctor PDF printed, you're ready to use Asciidoctor PDF!

Let's grab an AsciiDoc document to distill and start putting Asciidoctor PDF to use.
If you don't already have an AsciiDoc document, you can download and use the xref:attachment$basic-example.adoc[Basic Example AsciiDoc file].
Store the file in the current directory.

Let's take a look at the contents of that file.

.basic-example.adoc
[,asciidoc]
....
include::attachment$basic-example.adoc[]
....

It's time to convert the AsciiDoc document directly to PDF.

== Convert an AsciiDoc document to PDF

IMPORTANT: You'll need the `rouge` gem installed to run this example since it uses the `source-highlighter` attribute with the value of `rouge`.

Converting to PDF is as straightforward as running the `asciidoctor-pdf` command using Ruby and passing the AsciiDoc document as the first argument:

 $ asciidoctor-pdf basic-example.adoc

This command is a shorter way of running `asciidoctor` with the PDF converter and backend enabled:

 $ asciidoctor -r asciidoctor-pdf -b pdf basic-example.adoc

The `asciidoctor-pdf` command saves you from having to remember these low-level options.
That's why we provide it.

When the command completes, you should see the file [.path]_basic-example.pdf_ in the current directory.
Asciidoctor creates the output file in the same directory as the input file by default.
Open the [.path]_basic-example.pdf_ file with a PDF viewer to see the result.

== Convert to PDF using the API

In addition to the `asciidoctor-pdf` command, you can convert to PDF using the Asciidoctor API.
The selection of the Asciidoctor PDF converter is controlled through use of the `backend` keyword, which may be specified either as an API option or a document attribute.

First, make sure you have the Asciidoctor PDF gem installed and available on the Ruby runtime path.
Once that step is complete, require the `asciidoctor-pdf` gem to load the Asciidoctor PDF converter.

[,ruby]
----
require 'asciidoctor-pdf'
----

You can now use the main Asciidoctor API to convert an AsciiDoc document to PDF.

[,ruby]
----
require 'asciidoctor-pdf'

Asciidoctor.convert_file 'basic-example.adoc', backend: 'pdf', safe: :unsafe
----

This API call is equivalent to the command shown in the previous section.
The script first requires the *asciidoctor-pdf* gem (equivalent to `-r asciidoctor-pdf`).
Then it invokes Asciidoctor with the safe mode set to unsafe (equivalent to the `asciidoctor` command) and the backend to `pdf` (equivalent to `-b pdf`).
You can run this script using the `ruby` command.

When the script completes, you should see the file [.path]_basic-example.pdf_ in the current directory.
You can use the typical set of API options to customize where this file is written.

If you use the `convert` method instead of the `convert_file` method, Asciidoctor will return the instance of the converter (which is also an instance of `Prawn::Document`).
If you want to capture the PDF stream, you need to do so by redirecting the output to a StringIO object.

[,ruby]
----
require 'asciidoctor-pdf'
require 'stringio'

Asciidoctor.convert 'I *love* AsciiDoc!', backend: 'pdf', safe: :unsafe, to_file: (pdf = StringIO.new)
puts pdf.string
----

You can also capture the PDF stream after the fact by passing the returned document to the `write` method on that same object.

[,ruby]
----
require 'asciidoctor-pdf'
require 'stringio'

doc = Asciidoctor.convert 'I *love* AsciiDoc!', backend: 'pdf', safe: :unsafe
doc.write doc, (pdf = StringIO.new)
puts pdf.string
----

This call is the equivalent to the following:

[,ruby]
----
require 'asciidoctor-pdf'
require 'stringio'

puts (Asciidoctor.convert 'I *love* AsciiDoc!', backend: 'pdf', safe: :unsafe).render
----

The main difference is that calling `render` directly on the returned converter object does not trigger the cleanup routine, which is important when converting to PDF.
Thus, using a StringIO object as the target is preferable.
