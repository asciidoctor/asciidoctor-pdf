= Autofit Text

Verbatim blocks often have long lines that don't fit within the fixed width of the PDF canvas.
And unlike on the web, the PDF reader cannot scroll horizontally to reveal the overflow text.
Therefore, the long lines are forced to wrap.
Wrapped lines can make the verbatim blocks hard to read or even cause confusion.

To help address this problem, Asciidoctor PDF provides the `autofit` option on all verbatim--literal, listing and source--blocks to attempt to fit the text within the available width.

== autofit option

When the `autofit` option is enabled, Asciidoctor PDF will decrease the font size as much as it can until the longest line fits without wrapping.

CAUTION: The converter won't shrink the font size beyond the value of the `base_font_size_min` key specified in the PDF theme.
If that threshold is reached, lines may still wrap.
To allow `autofit` to handle all cases, set `base_font_size_min` to `0` in your theme.

Here's an example of the `autofit` option enabled on a source block:

[,asciidoc]
....
[source%autofit,java]
----
@SessionScoped
public class WidgetRepository {
    @GET
    @Produces("application/json")
    public List<String> listAll(@QueryParam("start") Integer start, @QueryParam("max") Integer max) {
        ...
    }
}
----

To enable the `autofit` option globally, set the `autofit-option` document attribute in the document header or before the relevant blocks in your content.
