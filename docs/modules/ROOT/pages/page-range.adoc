= Page Ranges

== Printing page ranges

The print dialog doesn't understand the page numbers labels (which appear in the running content).
Instead, it only considers physical pages.
Therefore, to print a range of pages as they are labeled in the document, you need to add the number of front matter pages (i.e., the non-numbered pages) to the page number range in the print dialog.

For example, if you only want to print the first 5 pages labeled with a page number (e.g., 1-5), and there are 2 pages before the page labeled as page 1, you need to add 2 to both numbers in the range, giving you a physical page range of 3-7.
That's the range you need to enter into the print dialog.
