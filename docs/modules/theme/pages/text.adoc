= Text Styles

[#text-align]
== Text alignment

The `text-align` key is used to align text horizontally within the text box.
It has the same function as the `text-align` property in CSS.

The text can be aligned using the following keywords:

`center`:: Text is centered within the text box.
`justify`:: Text is spaced out to align evenly with both sides of the text box.
`left`:: Text is aligned to the left side of the text box.
`right`:: Text is aligned to the right side of the text box.

The `text-align` key is distinct from the similarly-named `align` key.
The xref:blocks.adoc#align[align key] aligns a block element horizontally within its container.

[#decoration]
== Decoration

The `text-decoration` key specifies the type of decoration, such as an underline, that is applied to the text.
It accepts the following keywords:

`line-through`:: A line is drawn across the text.
This is commonly referred to as a strikethrough.
`none`:: Clears an inherited value and no decoration is applied to the text.
`underline`:: A line is drawn beneath the text.

When a key category allows the `text-decoration` key to be set, you can usually specify a `text-decoration-color` and `text-decoration-width`, too.

[#font-style]
== Font style

The `font-style` key specifies the font variant in a font family that the text should use.
The key accepts the following keywords:

`bold`:: Text is styled using the bold variant of a font family.
`bold_italic`:: Text is styled using the bold italic variant of a font family
`italic`:: Text is styled using the italic variant of a font family.
`normal`:: Text is styled using the normal font variant in a font family.
`normal_italic`:: The style of the text is reset to normal, and then the text is styled using the italic variant of a font family.

Usually, you can specify a font style wherever you can set a font family (`font-family`).
The converter uses the values of both keys in combination to locate the correct font within a font stack.

[#transform]
== Transform

The `text-transform` key changes the case of the text.
It accepts the following keywords:

`capitalize`:: Transforms the first letter of each word to a capital letter.
`none`:: Clears an inherited value and no case transformation is applied to the text.
`lowercase`:: Transforms all the text to lower case letters.
`uppercase`:: Transforms all the text to capital letters.

The `text-transform` key canâ€™t be set on the xref:base.adoc[base category].
