[#formats]
== Supported image formats

The following image types (and corresponding file extensions) are supported:

* PNG (.png)
* JPEG (.jpg)
* SVG (.svg)

CAUTION: CAUTION: The GIF (.gif), TIFF (.tiff), BMP (.bmp), and interlaced PNG formats are not supported unless you install prawn-gmagick.
See xref:ROOT:image-paths-and-formats.adoc#other-image-formats[Supporting additional image file formats] for details.

[#specify]
== Specify an image in a theme

An image is specified either as a bare image path or as an inline image macro as found in the AsciiDoc syntax.
Images in the theme file are currently resolved relative to the value of the `pdf-themesdir` attribute.
(If `pdf-theme` is a path that ends in `.yml`, and `pdf-themesdir` is not set, then the images are resolved relative to the directory of the path specified by `pdf-theme`).
If you want to use an image in your theme that's relative to the document you're converting, you can prefix the target with the `\{docdir}` attribute reference.

Here's how an image is specified in the theme file as a bare image path:

[source,yaml]
----
title-page:
  background-image: title-cover.png
----

Here's how the image is specified using the inline image macro:

[source,yaml]
----
title-page:
  background-image: image:title-cover.png[]
----

In either case, the image is resolved relative to the value of the `pdf-themesdir` attribute.
If you want to reference an image relative to the document you're converting, then prefix the target with the `\{docdir}` attribute reference.

[source,yaml]
----
title-page:
  background-image: image:{docdir}/images/title-cover.png[]
----

[#align]
== Width, fit, and alignment

Like in the AsciiDoc syntax, wrapping the value in the image macro allows you to specify other settings, such as `pdfwidth`, `fit`, and `align`.
For example:

[source,yaml]
----
title-page:
  logo-image: image:logo.png[pdfwidth=2.5in,align=center]
----

The `align` key is used to align images within the parent container.
Images can be aligned as follows:

* `left`
* `center`
* `right`
