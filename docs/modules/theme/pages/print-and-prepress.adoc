= Print and Prepress Modes

[#print]
== Print mode

Asciidoctor PDF provides the following behaviors to assist with printing:

* Shows the URLs for links unless the linked text matches the URL
* Consolidates page ranges in the index
* Deactivates the links from page numbers in the index to the locations of terms in the document

To enable these printing features, set the `media` document attribute to `print` in the header of your AsciiDoc document or from the API or CLI (e.g., `-a media=print`).
You may also want to consider using the print-optimized theme, which uses darker, grayscale colors for text and borders (e.g., `-a pdf-theme=default-for-print`).

[#prepress]
== Prepress mode

In addition to the <<print,print mode>>, Asciidoctor PDF provides the following behaviors to assist with publishing:

* Double-sided (mirror) page margins
* Automatic facing pages

Set the `media` attribute to `prepress` in the header of your AsciiDoc document or from the API or CLI (e.g., `-a media=prepress`) to activate the publishing features.
The following sections describe the behaviors that this setting activates.
You may also want to consider using the print-optimized theme, which uses darker, grayscale colors for text and borders (e.g., `-a pdf-theme=default-for-print`).

=== Double-sided page margins

The page margins for the recto (right-hand, odd-numbered) and verso (left-hand, even-numbered) pages are automatically calculated by replacing the side page margins with the values of the `page-margin-inner` and `page-margin-outer` keys.

For example, let's assume you've defined the following settings in your theme:

[,yaml]
----
page:
  margin: [0.5in, 0.67in, 0.67in, 0.67in]
  margin-inner: 0.75in
  margin-outer: 0.59in
----

The page margins for the recto and verso pages will be resolved as follows:

recto page margin:: [0.5in, *0.59in*, 0.67in, *0.75in*]
verso page margin:: [0.5in, *0.75in*, 0.67in, *0.59in*]

The page margins alternate between recto and verso.
The first page in the document (after the cover) is a recto page.

If no cover is specified, the recto margin is not applied to the title page.
To apply the recto margin to the title page, but not include a cover, assign the value `~` to the `front-cover-image` and `back-cover-image` attributes.

=== Automatic facing pages

When converting the book doctype using the `prepress` media setting, a blank page will be inserted when necessary to ensure the following elements start on a recto page:

* Title page
* Table of contents
* First page of body
* Parts and chapters

Other "`facing`" pages may be added in the future.

It's possible to disable the automatic facing feature for a given part or chapter.
This can be done by applying the `nonfacing` option to a section.
When the `nonfacing` option is present, the part or chapter title will be placed on the next adjacent page rather than the next facing page.
