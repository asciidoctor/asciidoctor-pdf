(default: 0)
|[source]
section:
  indent: [0.5in, 0]
|===

The `indent` keys applies to the section body only, excluding section titles and discrete headings.
A single value gets applied to both the left and right side (e.g., `0.5in`).
A two-value array configures the left and right side independently (e.g., `[0.5in, 0]`).
