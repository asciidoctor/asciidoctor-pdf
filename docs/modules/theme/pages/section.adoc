= Section Category Key
:description: Reference list of the available section category key and its value types.
:navtitle: Section
:source-language: yaml

The key in the `section` category controls the indent of a section body.

The `indent` keys applies to the section body only, excluding section titles and discrete headings.
A single value gets applied to both the left and right side (e.g., `0.5in`).
A two-value array configures the left and right side independently (e.g., `[0.5in, 0]`).
