= Add Running Content
:conum-guard-yaml: #

You can customize the arrangement and style of the running header and footer content by extending the built-in themes and using the `header`, `footer`, and `running-content` category keys.

== Activate the running content

The running content won't be activated unless:

. the periphery (header or footer) is configured, and
. the `height` key for the periphery is assigned a value.

By default, the built-in themes insert a footer with the page number on the right side of recto pages and the left side of verso pages if you don't specify any running content.
By extending the base or default themes, you can add content to and customize the layout of the header and footer, or disable the running content.
Using the `running-content` key, you can also <<start-at,specify on which page the header and footer start>>.

CAUTION: If the height of the running content periphery is taller than the page margin, the running content will cover the main content.
To avoid this problem, reduce the height of the running content periphery or make the page margin on that side larger.

See xref:running-content.adoc[] for the complete list of keys you can use to customize your running content.

[#start-at]
== Start page

By default, the running content starts on the first page of the document body.
You can specify on what page the running content starts using the `start-at` key.
The `start-at` key is set on the top-level `running-content` key in your theme.

[,yaml]
----
running-content:
  start-at: toc
----

The `start-at` key accepts the following keywords or an integer:

after-toc:: The running content starts after the TOC, no matter where the TOC is placed in the document.
The `after-toc` value is only recognized if the title page is implicitly or explicitly enabled.
If `media=prepress`, this keyword refers to the first recto page after the last page of the TOC (it will skip an empty verso page).
body:: This is the default value.
The running content starts on the first page of the document body, which is typically the first page after the TOC if the TOC is in its default location.
If `media=prepress`, this keyword refers to the first recto page after the last page of the TOC (it will skip an empty verso page).
title:: The running content starts on the title page.
The `title` value is only recognized if the title page is implicitly or explicitly enabled.
toc:: The running content starts on the first page of the TOC.
The `toc` value only applies if the TOC is in the default location (before the first page of the body).
If the value is `toc`, and the toc macro is used to position the TOC, the `start-at` behavior is the same as if the TOC is not enabled.
The `toc` value is only recognized if the title page is implicitly or explicitly enabled.
[[page]]Integer:: The running content starts on the page that matches the number assigned to `start-at` (i.e., 1 is the first body page, 2 is the second body page).
For a prepress book (`doctype=book` and `media=prepress`), the running content starts on the empty verso page before the body if the value is `0`.
When an integer is assigned to `start-at`, the title page doesn't need to be enabled.

TIP: To turn off the running content on TOC pages inserted by the toc macro, set the `noheader` or `nofooter` options on the macro (e.g., `toc::[opts=nofooter]`).

[#page-number]
== Modify page number position

To replace the alternating page numbers with a centered page number, you can restrict the footer to a single column and specify the content for the center position.

[,yaml]
----
extends: default
footer:
  columns: =100%
  recto:
    center:
      content: '{page-number}'
  verso:
    center:
      content: '{page-number}'
----

If the recto and verso keys have the same content, you can reduce the amount of configuring using a YAML reference.

[,yaml]
----
extends: default
footer:
  columns: =100%
  recto: &shared_footer
    center:
      content: '{page-number}'
  verso: *shared_footer
----

The `&shared_footer` assigns an ID to the YAML subtree under the `recto` key and the `*shared_footer` outputs a copy of it under the `verso` key.
This technique can be used throughout the theme file as it's a core feature of YAML.

To learn more about the default page numbering and how to customize the numbering, see xref:page-numbers.adoc[].

[#attribute-references]
== Attribute references

You can use any attribute defined in your AsciiDoc document (such as `doctitle`) in the content of the running header and footer.
In addition, the following attributes are also available when defining the content keys in the footer:

* `page-count` - the highest page number in the document (not necessarily the number of physical pages)
* `page-number` (only set if the `pagenums` attribute is set on the document, which it is by default)
* `page-layout`
* `document-title`
* `document-subtitle`
* `part-title`
* `part-numeral` (only set on part title page when part numbering is enabled)
* `chapter-title`
* `chapter-numeral` (only set on chapter title page when section numbering is enabled)
* `section-title`
* `section-or-chapter-title`

The value of the `+*-title+` attributes in the running content matches the text as it appears in the table of contents.
You can control the style of the text stored in these attributes using the `title-style` key on the periphery category (`header` or `footer`) in the theme.
The `title-style` key accepts the values `toc` (as the title appears in the TOC), `document` (as the title appears in the document), and `basic` (title only, no signifier or number prefix).

If you reference an attribute which is not defined, all the text on that same line in the running content will be dropped.
This feature allows you to have alternate lines that are selected when all the attribute references are satisfied.
One case where this is useful is when referencing the `page-number` attribute.
If you unset the `pagenums` attribute on the document, any line in the running content that makes reference to `\{page-number}` will be dropped.

You can also use built-in AsciiDoc text replacements like `+(C)+`, numeric character references like `+&#169;+`, hexadecimal character references like `+&#x20ac;+`, and inline formatting (e.g., bold, italic, monospace).

Here's an example that shows how attributes and replacements can be used in the running content:

[,yaml]
----
extends: default
header:
  height: 0.75in
  line-height: 1
  recto:
    center:
      content: '(C) ACME -- v{revnumber}, {docdate}'
  verso:
    center:
      content: $header-recto-center-content
footer:
  background-image: image:running-content-bg-{page-layout}.svg[]
  height: 0.75in
  line-height: 1
  recto:
    right:
      content: '{section-or-chapter-title} | {page-number} of {page-count}'
  verso:
    left:
      content: '{page-number} of {page-count} | *{chapter-title}*'
----

== Multi-line values

You can split the content value across multiple lines using YAML's multiline string syntax.
In this case, the single quotes around the string are not necessary.
To force a hard line break in the output, add `{sp}+` to the end of the line in normal AsciiDoc fashion.

[,yaml]
----
extends: default
footer:
  height: 0.75in
  line-height: 1.2
  recto:
    right:
      content: |
        Section Title - Page Number +
        {section-or-chapter-title} - *{page-number}*
  verso:
    left:
      content: |
        Page Number - Chapter Title +
        *{page-number}* - {chapter-title}
----

TIP: You can use most AsciiDoc inline formatting in the values of these keys.
For instance, to make the text bold, surround it in asterisks (as shown above).
One exception to this rule are inline images, which are described in the next section.

== Add an image

You can add an image to the running header or footer using the AsciiDoc inline image syntax.
The image target is resolved relative to the value of the `pdf-themesdir` attribute.
If the image macro is the whole value for a column position, you can use the `position` and `fit` attributes to align and scale it relative to the column box.
Otherwise, the image is treated like a normal inline image, for which you can only adjust the width.

Here's an example of how to use an image in the running header (which also applies for the footer).

[,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
extends: default
header:
  height: 0.75in
  image-vertical-align: 2 {conum-guard-yaml} <1>
  recto:
    center:
      content: image:footer-logo.png[pdfwidth=15pt]
  verso:
    center:
      content: $header-recto-center-content
----
<1> You can use the `image-vertical-align` key to slightly nudge the image up or down.

CAUTION: The image must fit in the allotted space for the running header or footer.
Otherwise, you'll run into layout issues or the image may not display.
You can adjust the width of the image to a fixed value using the `pdfwidth` attribute.
Alternatively, you can use the `fit` attribute to set the size of the image dynamically based on the available space.
Set the `fit` attribute to `scale-down` (e.g., `fit=scale-down`) to reduce the image size to fit in the available space or `contain` (i.e., `fit=contain`) to scale the image (up or down) to fit the available space.
You should not rely on the `width` attribute to set the image width when converting to PDF.

[#disable]
== Disable the header or footer

If you extend either the base or default theme, and don't specify content for the footer, the current page number will be added to the right side on recto pages and the left side on verso pages.
To turn off the default content, use the following snippet:

[,yaml]
----
extends: default
footer:
  recto:
    right:
      content: ~
  verso:
    left:
      content: ~
----

If you define running header and footer content in your theme (including the height), you can still disable this content per document by setting the `noheader` and `nofooter` attributes in the AsciiDoc document header, respectively.
