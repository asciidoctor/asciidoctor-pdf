= Extends Category Key
:navtitle: Extends
:source-language: yaml

A theme can extend another theme using the `extends` key.

The `extends` key accepts either a single value or an array of values.
Each value is interpreted as a filename.
If the filename equals `default`, it resolves to the location of the default (built-in) theme.
If the filename is absolute, it's used as is.
If the filename begins with `./`, it's resolved as a theme file relative to the current theme file.
Otherwise, the filename is resolved as a theme file in the normal way (relative to the value of the `pdf-themesdir` attribute).

Currently, the theme starts out empty.
Then, the files referenced by the extends key are loaded in order.
Finally, the keys in the current file are loaded.
Each time a theme is loaded, the keys are overlaid onto the keys from the previous theme.
