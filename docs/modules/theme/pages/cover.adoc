= Cover Category Keys
:navtitle: Cover
:source-language: yaml

The keys in the `cover` category control the front and back cover images.
Currently, the only supported feature is setting an image for each cover face.
`<face>` is either `front` or `back`.

|===

When assigning a value to `image` using the image macro, the target of the macro can be an image file or a PDF file.
A relative path of the target file is resolved relative to the value of the `pdf-themesdir` attribute.
An image file is handled just like a background image.
If a PDF file is specified, the first page is used unless another page is specified by the `page` attribute.
The page from the PDF file will be imported as is.
