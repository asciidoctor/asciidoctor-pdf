== Alignment

The `align` key is used to align a block element horizontally within its parent container.
This key is used for non-text elements, such as an image, table, or caption with a narrower width than the content area.
It's roughly akin to the function of the `align-self` property of a flexbox element in CSS (when the flex direction is row).

The element can be aligned using the following keywords:

* `left`
* `center`
* `right`

The `align` key is distinct from the similarly-named `text-align` key.
The latter key aligns text within the container (i.e., the text box) using text alignment rules.
