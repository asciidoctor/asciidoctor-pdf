== Block alignment

The `align` key is used to align a block element horizontally within its parent container.
This key is used for non-text elements, such as an image, table, or caption with a narrower width than the content area.
It's roughly akin to the function of the `align-self` property of a flexbox element in CSS (when the flex direction is row).

The element can be aligned using the following keywords:

`center`:: The block is centered horizontally within the parent container.
`left`:: The block is aligned to the left side of the parent container.
`right`:: The block is aligned to the right side of the parent container.

The `align` key is distinct from the similarly-named `text-align` key.
The xref:text.adoc#text-align[text-align key] aligns text within the text box using text alignment rules.
