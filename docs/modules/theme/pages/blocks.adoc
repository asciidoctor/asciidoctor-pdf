= Block Styles
:description: The theming language provides numerous keys for arranging blocks and styling their borders.

The block styles can be applied to most blocks, including section headings, delimited blocks, admonitions, tables, captions, and block images.

[#align]
== Block alignment

The `align` key is used to align a block horizontally within its parent container.
This key is used for non-text elements, such as an image, table, or caption with a narrower width than the content area.
It's roughly akin to the function of the `align-self` property of a flexbox element in CSS (when the flex direction is row).

The block can be aligned using the following keywords:

center:: The block is centered horizontally within the parent container.
left:: The block is aligned to the left side of the parent container.
right:: The block is aligned to the right side of the parent container.

The `align` key is distinct from the similarly-named `text-align` key.
The xref:text.adoc#text-align[text-align key] aligns text within the text box using text alignment rules.

[#caption-align]
=== Caption alignment

In addition to the alignment keywords listed in the <<align>> section, the `caption-align` key accepts the keyword `inherit` when it is set on the `image` or `table` category.

[,yaml]
----
image:
  caption:
    align: inherit
----

The value `inherit` resolves to the alignment of the block image or table.

[#border-width]
== Border width

The `border-width` key specifies the width of the border applied to a block.
The key accepts a single measurement value or an array of measurements.
When a single value is assigned to `border-width`, that value is applied to all four edges of the border.

.Single value assigned to border-width
[,yaml]
----
sidebar:
  border-width: 4 <1>
----
<1> You don't need to enclose a single value in a set of square brackets.
If you do enclose the value in square brackets, it will be treated as an array, and any value assigned to the `border-radius` key will be ignored.

When a 2-value array is assigned to `border-width`, the first value is applied to the top and bottom borders, and the second value is applied to the left and right side borders.

.Two-value array assigned to border-width
[,yaml]
----
example:
  border-width: [0.5, 2]
----

When a 4-value array is assigned to `border-width`, the first value is applied to the top border, the second to the right side border, the third to the bottom border, and the fourth to the left side border.

.Four-value array assigned to border-width
[,yaml]
----
heading:
  h2-border-width: [0.75, 0, 2, 0]
----

If you don't want a border applied to a block category, assign a tilde (`~`) to the `border-width` key.

.Unset border-width
[,yaml]
----
sidebar:
  border-width: ~
----

[#border-color]
== Border color

The `border-color` key specifies the color of a border.
It accepts the following types of values:

Hex, RGB, or CMYK color:: A single color specified using the hex, RGB, or CMYK format.
See xref:color.adoc[] to learn how to assign a value using these formats in the theming language.
transparent:: A special keyword that indicates a color should not be used when drawing the border.
Array of colors:: *Only applies to the `table` category*.
An array that specifies xref:tables.adoc#border-color[a color per edge on tables].

The value assigned to `border-color` is ignored if `border-width` isn't implicitly or explicitly set or is set to `0` on the category.

[#radius]
== Border radius

The `border-radius` key rounds the corners of a block's outer border.
It accepts a single measurement value.

[,yaml]
----
sidebar:
  border-width: 4
  border-radius: 2
----

The value assigned to the `border-radius` key is ignored if `border-width` is assigned an array of values.
The `border-radius` key can't be set on the `table` category.

[#border-style]
== Border style

The `border-style` key specifies the line style used when drawing a border.
In most cases, it accepts the following values:

dashed:: The border is drawn as a series of short line segments.
dotted:: The border is drawn as a series of rounded dots.
double:: The border is drawn as two parallel, straight, solid lines.
The `double` value can't be applied to table borders.
solid:: The border is drawn as a straight, single line.
Array of styles:: *Only applies to the `table` category*.
An array that specifies xref:tables.adoc#border-style[a style per edge on tables].

The value assigned to a `border-style` key is ignored on a block category if `border-width` isn't implicitly or explicitly set or `border-width` is set to `0` on the category.
