= Quoted String

Some keys accept a quoted string as text content.
The final segment of these keys is always named `content`.

A content key accepts a string value.
It's usually best to quote the string or use the http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/yaml/yaml_format.html#strings[YAML multi-line string syntax].

Text content may be formatted using a subset of inline HTML.
You can use the well-known elements such as `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<code>`, `<a>`, `<sub>`, `<sup>`, `<del>`, and `<span>`.
The `<span>` element supports the `style` attribute, which you can use to specify the `color`, `font-weight`, and `font-style` CSS properties.
You can also use the `rgb` attribute on the `<color>` element to change the color or the `name` and `size` attributes on the `<font>` element to change the font properties.
If you need to add an underline or strikethrough decoration to the text, you can assign the `underline` or `line-through` to the `class` attribute on any aforementioned element.

Here's an example of using formatting in the content of the menu caret:

[source,yaml]
----
menu-caret-content: " <font size=\"1.15em\"><color rgb=\"#b12146\">\u203a</color></font> "
----

NOTE: The string must be double quoted in order to use a Unicode escape code like `\u203a`.

Additionally, normal substitutions are applied to the value of content keys for xref:running-content.adoc[running content], so you can use most AsciiDoc inline formatting (e.g., `+*strong*+` or `+{attribute-name}+`) in the values of those keys.
