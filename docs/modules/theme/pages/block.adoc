= Block Category Keys
:navtitle: Block
:source-language: yaml

The keys in the `block` category control the anchor position and spacing below block elements when a more specific setting isn't designated.
The bottom margin is only added if the block is followed by an adjacent block within the same enclosure (e.g., a sidebar, a table cell, or the area outside any blocks).

[cols="3,4,6a"]
