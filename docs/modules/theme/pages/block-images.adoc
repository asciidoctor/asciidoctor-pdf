= Block Image Styles
:description: In addition to the general block and caption keys, the theming language provides keys for arranging and styling block images, alt text, and image captions.

In general, the xref:blocks.adoc[] apply to block images and their captions.
You can further customize how the block images, alt text, and captions are arranged and styled using the xref:block-image.adoc[].
The following sections provide information and examples about the keys and values that are unique to the block images.

[#caption-align]
== Caption alignment

In addition to the xref:blocks.adoc#align[standard block alignment keywords (center, left, and right)], the `caption-align` key accepts the keyword `inherit` when it is set on the `image` category.

[,yaml]
----
image:
  caption:
    align: inherit
----

When the value is `inherit`, the key will inherit the alignment assigned to the image itself (`image-align`).
The `caption-align` key is distinct from the similarly-named `caption-text-align` key.
The <<caption-text-align,caption-text-align key>> aligns text within the text box of the caption block using text alignment rules.

[#end]
== Caption end

The `caption-end` key specifies whether the image caption is located on top or below the image.
The key accepts the following keywords:

bottom:: The caption block is placed below the image.
top:: The caption block is place above the image.

[,yaml]
----
image:
  caption:
    end: bottom
----

[#caption-text-align]
== Caption text alignment

The `caption-text-align` key controls the alignment of the caption text within the bounds of the caption.
The key accepts the keyword `inherit` in addition to the xref:text.adoc#text-align[usual text alignment values] when it is set on the `image` category.

[,yaml]
----
image:
  caption:
    text-align: inherit
----

When the value is `inherit`, the key will inherit the alignment assigned to the image itself (`image-align`).

The `caption-text-align` key is distinct from the similarly-named `caption-align` key.
The <<caption-align,caption-align key>> aligns a caption block horizontally within its container.
