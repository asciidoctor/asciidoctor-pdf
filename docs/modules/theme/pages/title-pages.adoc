= Title Page
:description: The title page layout, background, logo image, and document title, authors, and revision information can be styled from the theme.

The layout, background, and styling of the title page and the title, author, and revision information displayed on it is controlled from the theme using the keys in the `title-page` category.

IMPORTANT: The title page is only enabled by default for the book document type (e.g., `:doctype: book`).
To enable the title page when using a different doctype, such as the default `article` doctype, you must define the xref:ROOT:title-page.adoc[title-page attribute in the document header].

For the list of all available `title-page` theme keys, see xref:title-page.adoc[].

[#deactivate]
== Deactivate

The title page can be deactivated from the theme by assigning `false` to the `title-page` category key.

[,yaml]
----
title-page: false
----

You can also xref:ROOT:title-page.adoc#notitle-attribute[deactivate the title page from the document header] using the `notitle` attribute.

[#background-color]
== Background color

A background color can be applied to the title page with the `background-color` key.
The key accepts the xref:color.adoc[hex, RGB, and CMYK formats].

[,yaml]
----
title-page:
  background-color: #EAEAEA
----

To turn off the background color for the title page, set the value to white (`#FFFFFF`).
The color keyword `transparent` isn't recognized in this context.

[,yaml]
----
title-page:
  background-color: #FFFFFF
----

[#background-image]
== Background image

You can apply a background image to the title page using the `background-image` key.

[,yaml]
----
title-page:
  background-image: image:title.png[]
----

For accepted values and attributes, see xref:images.adoc#background[Background images].

[#logo-image]
== Logo image

The target of the image macro assigned to the `image` key may be a data URI, absolute path, or a path relative to the value of the `pdf-themesdir` attribute.
Like in the AsciiDoc syntax, wrapping the `image` value in the image macro allows you to specify other settings, including `pdfwidth` and `align`.
For example:

[,yaml]
----
title-page:
  logo:
    image: image:logo.png[pdfwidth=2.5in,align=center]
----

The `align` setting is used to align block images within the parent container.
See xref:blocks.adoc[] for accepted alignment keywords.
