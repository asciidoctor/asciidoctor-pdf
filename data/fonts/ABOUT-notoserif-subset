Noto Serif fonts are generated from the google-noto-serif-fonts-20161022 Fedora RPM package Noto Serif.

The following changes were made using fontforge to produce the notoserif-*-subset.ttf fonts:

* Mapped single arrows <- (U+2190) and -> (U+2192) to double arrows <= (U+21d0) and => (U+21d2)
* Manually added non-breaking hyphen (U+2011) from hyphen (U+002d)
* Moved arrows (U+21d0, U+21d2, U+2190, U+2192) up in line to align with middle of X
* Subsetted to include:
